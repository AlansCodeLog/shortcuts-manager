# Name Pending

This is a shortcut manager library for handling ALL the shortcut needs of an application.

# [Docs](https://alanscodelog.github.io/shortcuts-manager)

# [Demo (very WIP, am currently using as testing playground)](https://alanscodelog.github.io/shortcuts-manager/demo)

- Will not work locally unless my very WIP, currently private, vue component lib is locally linked.

# Features

	- Has methods for swapping/moving the chain base.
- Has ability to check if shortcuts can be set, if they interfere with existing ones.
	- Custom hooks can be added to prevent certain shortcuts.
- Manages layouts.
- Manages keys.
- Handles all input.
- Plugable and highly flexible.
- Lots more... #todo
